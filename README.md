sandbar-example-lein2-ring
==========================

Example using sandbar clojure library using Lein 2 and Ring-server.

This example could be considered a-kind-of fork of https://github.com/brentonashworth/sandbar-examples , except that 
I just took the sessions file and re-adapt it so that it works with Leiningen 2 and Ring-server.

## Prerequisites

You will need [Leiningen][1] 1.7.0 or above installed.

## Running

To start a web server for the application, run:

    lein ring server
